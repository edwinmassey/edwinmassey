    <h2 class= "size2 box1 colour1 font1 center">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h2>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Introduction</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        I am happy with the tools with tools I have selected to use, in order to crate my website.
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Trello</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        Using Trello has allowed me to plan each step of creating my website. I created a card for each task that needed to be complete, I started off with ensuring I answered all questions for this module so that I had my main content for the website. I then made sure to plan how I would create my website, updating Trello as I continued to create my website with everything I had done in order to achieve this. I have been happy using Trello as I feel it has been an essential part of my planning and helping me to stay organised.
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Visual studio code</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        Visual studio code enabled me to write up the coding to create my website. I have been delighted using Visual studio code as after creating a Python game I have become very familiar with the layout of this software. With how simple I have found it to use I have enjoyed creating my website within this software. 
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Slack</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        Using Slack has allowed me to communicate with my instructor and getting useful resources such as course materials. I am happy using Slack as I have found this to be easy to use with a navigation bar on the side to choose any chat necessary such as a zoom link chat or a course materials chat.
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Zoom</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        Using Zoom to host group sessions where my instructor can teach me and my fellow developers has allowed for learning to still be made possible even during social distancing. I have found Zoom to be easy to use with just clicking on a link to join the meeting for the day.
