    <h2 class= "size2 box1 colour1 font1 center">Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Introduction</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        IT in modern business has many purposes. I will discuss some of the main purposes. 
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Product development</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        One purpose information technology has is that it improves research. With IT you can research what product or service customers are looking for in order to provide the best service or create the ideal product for them. There are many tools a business can use to work collaboratively speeding up the development process as they can work together from different locations. They can also provide services from various locations such as a business located in London having a call centre set up in China.
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Decision making</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        With IT in businesses it will lead to faster more accurate decisions being made as higher ups within the business can look at data such as spreadsheets and graphs to see where they can be cost effective. This will help stakeholders as they have access to information to make informed decisions about what they want to invest. Businesses can also look at other strategies competitors are using in order to compete with them. For example if Microsoft are releasing a new console Sony will be quick to release a new console as well in order to keep or gain market share.
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Globalisation</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        With IT it allows businesses to sell to customers anywhere in the world. Without IT businesses may be limited to customers in their city or country but with IT global shipping is possible. This will greatly increase the number of potential customers a business can have. Also there is an opportunity to hire employees from other countries to work more effiectvely such as a business based in London having a call centre set up in India. Or such as Nike having factories in China.
