    <h2 class= "size2 box1 colour1 font1 center">3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
        productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Benefits</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        When creating the website using Trello to plan has been very time efficient. With Trello planning was made simple as I started by answering some unit questions then by creating the website, updating Trello as I did. This saved me time thinking ahead. With using Virtual studio code having one CSS stylesheet I found to be efficient as I could apply styling to all pages through the stylesheet.

    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Drawbacks</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        With this project I could have been more productive by working within a team. Working within a team would have allowed for us as a team to delegate individuals to work on a specific part of the website. Doing this would have saved a lot of time but by also working within a team there would have been more time for research and a chance to help each other to add more elements onto the website.
