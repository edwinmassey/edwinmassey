    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">The impact it will have</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        This regulation will impact digital projects as for example if you are creating a website that will store personal data then you need to comply with the regulation otherwise you will face a serious fine and have your business reputation impacted. This could result in users not trusting you leading to them not using your website. 
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">How to keep within guidelines</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        In order to keep within the guidelines before users input personal data let them read the terms and conditions of what data you are going to store. Provide them information of what data you are going to store, how you are going to use and process their data and the security measures put in place to keep their data safe. Allow users to agree to opt in letting them know they agree to have their data being used by the business. To reduce the risks of not complying with the guidelines you can minimise how much data you are storing by only having users input necessary data.
