    <h2 class= "size2 box1 colour1 font1 center">Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Introduction</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        When creating a digital project there are many risks that you can face while in creation of the project.
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Risks</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center"> 
        For an example if you are building a website for 5 months but after a few months Apple releases a new software update that results in your website no longer being compatible with the update. This is a risk that may cause your project to fail as you may have been making good progress in building your website but may need to start over. This would mean time wasted and during this time a competitor may have created a website compatible with the new update resulting in clients using their website.
    </p>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        Another risk could be that a team member no longer is available to work on the project resulting in digital project not being complete for another few months. This would not be efficient for time or money.
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">4 Types of risks</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        There are four main types of risks. Risks that you know are going to happen and you’re ready on how to deal with them, risks that are going to happen but you’re not fully sure on how to deal with them. Risks that you don’t know are going to happen but you're prepared on how to handle them and risks that you don’t know are going to happen and you're unsure as to how you will deal with them. The worst types of risks are ones that you are unsure as to how to overcome them which could cause your project to fail.
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Planning for risks</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        It is important when planning to be ready for any risks that may occur as not planning for any issues and they do occur will result in the project failing. However the best thing to do is plan for any risks in advance preparing on how to handle and overcome them if they do occur, this will result in your project being successful if you are well prepared.
