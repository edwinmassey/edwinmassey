    <h2 class= "size2 box1 colour1 font1 center">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Introduction</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        I have found that the selected IT tools used have been appropriate to allow me to create my website.
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Trello</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        Using Trello has been very effective for me in terms of planning. Creating a board where I have used the Kanban method has helped me to get everything completed, in terms of the content of my website, to creating my website. The layout has been simple to use which I have found easy to use
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Visual studio code</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        Visual studio code has been an appropriate tool to create my website. Using Visual studio code it has allowed me to create a CSS style sheet where I have coded how my website will layout and be styled. It has let me create HTML pages where I can input the content of my website. I have found Visual studio code to be very useful as commands such comments have been effective with helping me remember some codes. 
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Slack</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        After using Slack I feel it has been an appropriate choice to use. As with using Slack there has been a notification every time something new has been uploaded to the chats, so if my instructor has put a new presentation in the chat, I can look back through the powerpoint to help me understand. This has been very effective with sharing resources.
    </p>
    <h3 class= "size3 box1 colour1 font1 center">Zoom</h3>
    <p class= "sizetext boxtext colour1 fonttext center">
        I have found Zoom to be a useful tool during this course. With being able to join the Zoom call with one click of a link it has been effective to ask questions with anything I am unsure on. It has also been effective with my instructor teaching using this tool.
